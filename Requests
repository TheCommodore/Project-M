Requests by Hetalk 
  > Do what msa1390 asked above. :)
  > Add a screenshot option in the nav bar, if there are couple more people ask for it.
  > Don't add pie, unless 100+ users ask for it.
  > I found that I see the error message, that I reported on xda thread, everytime I reboot the phone and connect to internet. See if this helps.
  > Show available RAM in recents window. If possible, show it on statusbar. That would be even awesomer.
